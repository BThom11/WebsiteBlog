I am currently a Statistical Analyst with Colorado public health, with a past in quantitative UX research at Facebook, and DAT. I've lived in CO most of my life, and have the classic hobbies of mtn biking, climbing, & skiing to reflect it.

I received my M.S. in Cognitive Sciences from UC Irvine, where I focused on Bayesian Cognitive Modeling, and models of judgement and decision making with Michael Lee.
More generally I love working with complex behavioral data, and developing statistical models to help handle that complexity and better test hypotheses.
